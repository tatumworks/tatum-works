• Foreman (2005)
• Superintendent (2007)
• General Superintendent (2014)
• Small Owner (2021)

Dustin has managed nearly every type of water, storm, and service project Colorado offers. His commitment to excellence and safety has earned awards from Denver, Westminster, and Boulder, recognizing outstanding job completion and site management.
